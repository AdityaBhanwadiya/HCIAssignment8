🌍 Hello World with Azure OpenAI API
Hey there! Welcome to this project where we tap into the power of the Azure OpenAI API to generate a fun "Hello World" message. If you're looking to get started quickly, you’ve come to the right place.

🚀 Quick Overview
Goal: Call Azure OpenAI, ask it for a creative "Hello World," and display the result.
What You’ll See: A short, imaginative greeting that proves the API is doing its magic behind the scenes.
🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
Open your terminal (or command prompt).
Run:
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
2. Install dependencies
Inside the project folder, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will pull in all the libraries you need, including openai and python-dotenv.

3. Configure your API keys
Create a file named .env in the project folder. Inside, add:

AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your-deployment-name
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4

Note: Replace your-api-key, your-resource-name, etc., with your actual Azure details.

4. Run the script
Finally, let’s see it in action! Run:

python main.py
If everything’s set up correctly, you’ll get a playful Hello World message from Azure OpenAI.

🔥 Reflection
Working on this project taught me a few things:

Adapting to the new OpenAI 1.0 API: Some function calls changed, which meant updating my code to the new format.
Azure-specific Authentication: Azure’s deployment names and endpoints can be tricky at first. But once you get the hang of it, it’s straightforward.
Environment Variables: Using .env to store keys is way safer than hardcoding them. Plus, it keeps your repo nice and clean.
